This project is an application of Data-Driven business intelligence tools and techniques to study global launch business using various open sources of data.
Our objective is to provide an analytical framework that is part of the Data Science life cycle, that will prove to be an advantage to the EAC Spaceport Feasibility Study research team.
By applying methodologies in data science to prove the "low cost", "reliability" and other aspects of what would constitute an ideal launch site depending on the desired application for stakeholders. The objective of this project is to provide the EAC Spaceport Feasibility Study team insight into launch business based on past data and current trends to better predict the future of the industry using statistical analysis

If I had only one hour to save the world I would spend fifty five mins defining the problem and only five mins thinking of the solution. (~ Albert Einsine) I like this quote because the ability to plan is the key to success. For us aspiring Software Engineers, were taught this level of thinking is referred to as the Software Development Life Cycle. We Broke our project into 5 basic phases. 

Phase I the most important phase planning here we answer the 5 Ws Who, What, When, Where, and Why. We also reviewed what tools we may need meaning platforms, programing languages, environments, and last but certainly not least we needed to choose a DB whether relational or non relational.  Once our problem was defined, It was safe to say we could now move to

Phase 2 the analysis. In this phase we need to put the pieces together then develop a brute force approach then desk check our plan. That means walk through the entire life cycle and think through any thing that could possibly go wrong or right. As master yoda would say become one with the system. (ha ha) 

Phase 3 the design phase led us to optimization, how can we make this process as seamless as possible in addition, can we develop it to run within a specified time complexity with all its moving parts? As most other software engineers are thinking right about now, yes BigO came walking in the room again. (ha ha) 

Phase 4 the implementation,this is  where we really get our hands dirty implementing the lifecycle into deployment. 

Finally, Phase 5 Maintenance, this is where we focused heavy on User Access. Creating Groups to insure the integrity of the data.
